# Food-Sales-Price-Prediction
This project was aimed to build a robust regression model to predict Total Sales using historical food sales data 'Sample data food slaes.xlsx'. The dataset contains transactional records including region, city, product category, quantity, unit price, and order dates.

The primary goals of this project includes:

Exploring and understanding the dataset through visual and statistical methods.
Cleaning and preparing the data with essential feature engineering.
Building a predictive model to estimate total sales using Linear Regression.
Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like R² Score, MAE, AbsCoefficient, Residuals/performance errors and RMSE etc.
Exporting insights and predictions for visualization in tools like Excel and Power BI.
This end-to-end process demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline—from raw data ingestion to model development and real world deployment integration helping stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions to optimize sales performance.
